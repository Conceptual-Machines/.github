# Conceptual Machines

Welcome to **Conceptual Machines**—an organization dedicated to advancing open-source development in the fields of neural modeling, audio processing, digital audio workstation (DAW) control, language tooling, and more. Our projects range from multi-language frameworks for DSLs, through neural audio processing, to tools for measuring plugin behavior and innovative agent-based frameworks.

## Mission

Our mission is to enable the creation and accessibility of tools for creative computation, intelligent systems, and advanced workflows in music technology and beyond.
